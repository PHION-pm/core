PHION's client-side core python library. This library is not meant to be used directly by users. If you want to install phion please use the [CLI tool](https://github.com/PHION-pm/cli). For more information check the installation guide in the [Documentation](https://docs.phion.cf)

## Installation

PHION is available at pypi and can be easily installed using pip. Either you can do that or you can directly build from source as well.

### Installing from PiP

Recommended to do this in a virtual environment - 
```bash
$ python -m pip install phion
```

### Installing from source

This is not a great option unless you know what you are doing. Breaking changes may mess up whatever you were working on.

```bash
$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/PHION-pm/core.git#egg=phion
```
